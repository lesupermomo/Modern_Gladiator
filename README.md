# Modern_Gladiator
This is my first c++ game made with unreal engine 4 which is unfinished, the game allows you to shoot lasers on boxes that move when hit.
learning from tutorials on youtube (Dev ENabled) and the beauty of the internet.

this is a 'Playable' version. Unfortunately I no longer have space to use github for this project.
